# Game Concept
Understanding word roots helps us understand new language. Understanding carroots helps grow your carrots as you build words using their roots as a base. How big can your carroot grow? Every carroot you sell earns you money to continue to buy seeds.  Plant the seeds and fertilize them with prefixes and suffixes; or, other roots!

# About Assets
All assets (graphics, sound, and music) are either free placeholders or initially made by the team.

# Development
